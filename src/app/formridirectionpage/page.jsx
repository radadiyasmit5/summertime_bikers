            <p>
              As you donâ€™t have a valid licence, no rental company can rent out
              a bike to you. Even if you can find a motorcycle, you cannot drive
              it to the test centre because you are not licensed in the first
              place.

              Submit all your contact details and basic information to find out
              how much it will cost to get one of our motorcycles directly to
              your test centre to complete your Balance/Road test.
